To prepare your machine for building the project:

# apt-get -t unstable install \
     libresiprocate-1.8-dev librecon-1.8-dev libsipxtapi-dev \
     libresiprocate-turn-client-1.8-dev


To build this project, note that CPPFLAGS are necessary:

$ git clone $REPOSITORY
$ cd reConServer
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/sipxtapi -DDEFAULT_BRIDGE_MAX_IN_OUTPUTS=10 -D__pingtel_on_posix__ -D_linux -D_REENTRANT -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"
$ make


To run the project, see the original testua_readme.txt

Outstanding issues
------------------

Doesn't quite compile yet against the Debian packages:

- currently the reTurn client headers are installed to
     /usr/include/reTurnClient

- instead, we must install to /usr/include/reTurn/client

- must also install missing stuff to /usr/include/reTurn

- must consider fixing relative include paths within reTurn/*/*.hxx

To work around the above issues, add -I${YOUR_RESIPROCATE_TREE} to CPPFLAGS
